## Final Portfolio Project – Danika Reyes

🌺 About Me:  Hi, I'm Danika! I'm a senior in high school with a passion for learning computer science. Over the past year, I've explored a variety of programming languages and tools, gaining hands-on experience in learning Javascript and C++ by creating projects on my own and with my classmates! I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and applying my skills to build my career in computer science. 

🔎 Project Overview: This portfolio project represents the culmination of my work during the school year in AP Compsci P. It showcases a collection of projects that I've built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through these projects, I learned how to improve execute my ideas and translate them to tangiable code that user's can interact with! From simple games to interactive tools, each project reflects my progress in my learning and problem-solving abilities.

## Featured Projects

🃏 Blackjack: A simplified version of the classic casino game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player starts with two random cards and can choose to draw additional cards to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The game dynamically updates the card values, sum, and win/loss messages in real-time. Includes personalized player name functionality and a themed visual design with a poker table background for an immersive experience.

✍️ Quote & Poem Generator This creative tool generates random quotes and short poems. It gave me experience with using arrays, JavaScript functions, and DOM manipulation to dynamically update page content.

🥁 Drum Kit Sound Board A fun and interactive sound board that plays different drum sounds when users click buttons or press keyboard keys. This project introduced me to working with event listeners and audio elements in JavaScript.
