## Final Portfolio Project – Danika Reyes

🌺 About Me:  Hi, I'm Danika! I'm a senior in high school with a passion for learning computer science. Over the past year, I've explored a variety of programming languages and tools, gaining hands-on experience in learning Javascript and C++ by creating projects on my own and with my classmates! I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and applying my skills to build my career in computer science. 

🔎 Project Overview: This portfolio project represents the culmination of my work during the school year in AP Compsci P. It showcases a collection of projects that I've built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through these projects, I learned how to improve execute my ideas and translate them to tangiable code that user's can interact with! From simple games to interactive tools, each project reflects my progress in my learning and problem-solving abilities.
