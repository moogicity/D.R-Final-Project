I am majoring in data science in college and I hope to expand on my CS knowledge. </h3>

        <h2>This project was originally done in class, but I've made some minor corrections to the code since then! It's a bare bones version of the classic game, Black Jack. You start with two cards and hit until you get 21 (black jack!) or go over.</h2
